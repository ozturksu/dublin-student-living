Elmville offers stunning 1-bedroom apartment; comfortable, very tastefully designed and flooded with natural light. The apartment is thoughtfully furnished and finished to a high standard with the notable treatment of bespoke interior design solutions, wholly unique to the unit.

The entrance hallway is generously sized with thick light grey carpeting to create an immediate sense of welcome. The interior here utilises a soft light grey and tan colour palette with warm lighting, suggestive of the overall comfort and security that the home offers. A large square gilded mirror hangs above a wide and shallow table in the hall, contemporary minimalist in design which fits the space perfectly.

The fully equipped kitchen/dining area features brick tiling splash backs and sleek modern workspaces with several high performance appliances. The integrated dishwasher, washer/dryer, oven and ceramic hob are from Beko, the microwave is Teka and the fridge/freezer is Electrolux - all highly efficient. Key in the design of the kitchen is its marriage of vintage and contemporary; it is aesthetically ‘homely’ and almost familiar while it celebrates and accommodates our more modern lifestyles.

The dining area enjoys the openness and flow from the kitchen while remaining its own intimate setting. The table is well sized and keeps with the soft grey theme with comfy seating such that the space brings all the right majesty to meal-time aided by the luxurious beige leather chairs which really compliment the space aided by the soft lighting of a featured lampshade directly above the table.

The dining area leads on to the main living space where a large stylish rug with hints of blue creates a generous and airy openness among the seating, which includes a matching soft yellow two-seater couch and armchair as well as a stylish grey single-seater offering lots of options for relaxing in the space. There is a dedicated work station to the side of the living area, private and secluded with a comfortable desk and chair, created with modern living in mind. Floor-to-ceiling sliding doors flood the room with natural light, leading out on to a large patio which runs the width of the room.

The bedroom is designed to champion downtime - with a sanctuary of solitude and rest. Thick carpeting and a laid-back colour palette ensure that the rooms maintains their own relaxed atmosphere, separate to whatever hustle and bustle might lie beyond the door.

The bedroom offers a very comfortable and low-standing bedframe, picking up the room’s subtle tones with an attractive wooden trim. This extends to the wardrobe, bedside locker, chest of drawers and an elegant dressing table to complete the suite. Floor-length curtains will guarantee darkness when required, but the window is thoughtfully positioned to make the most of the morning light. Featuring an ensuite bathroom with attractive wood-effect flooring and a large shower with marble wall-tiling.

The uniqueness of Elmville is that the keen eye of the interior designer is evident throughout and the main bathroom is no exception. The large bath/shower delightfully features the notorious chic subway wall tiles, a long-standing favourite in practical-meets-pleasing bathroom design.

The apartment is fitted with an intercom system for permission of access from within. The home is heated using an air-source pump and heat-recovery unit, a sensible and modern solution - highly efficient with low running costs.

The apartment is thoughtfully furnished and finished to a high standard with the notable treatment of bespoke interior design solutions, wholly unique to the unit.

The entrance hallway is generously sized with thick carpeting to create an immediate sense of welcome. The interior here utilises a soft tan colour palette and warm lighting, suggestive of the overall comfort and security that the home offers. A large modern mirror hangs above a wide and shallow table, contemporary minimalist in design.

The fully equipped kitchen/dining area features wood-effect tiling and sleek modern workspaces with several high performance appliances. The integrated dishwasher, washer/dryer, oven and ceramic hob are from Beko, the microwave is Teka and the fridge/freezer is Electrolux - all highly efficient. Key in the design of the kitchen is its marriage of vintage and contemporary; it is aesthetically ‘homely’ and almost familiar while it celebrates and accommodates our more modern lifestyles.

The dining area enjoys the openness and flow from the kitchen while remaining its own intimate setting. The table is elegant with restaurant-style seating such that the space brings all the right majesty to meal-time aided by the luxurious charcoal chairs which really brings the table to life.

The dining area leads on to the main living space where a large stylish rug creates a generous and airy openness among the seating, which includes a matching blue two-seater couch and armchair as well as a more minimalist and rather stylish grey single-seater. There is a dedicated work station to one side of the living area, private and secluded with a comfortable desk and chair, created with modern living in mind. Floor-to-ceiling sliding doors flood the room with natural light, leading out on to a large balcony which runs the width of the room.

The bedrooms are designed to champion downtime - each one a sanctuary of solitude and rest. Thick carpeting and a laid-back colour palette ensure that the rooms maintains their own relaxed atmosphere, separate to whatever hustle and bustle might lie beyond the door. The beds are large, very comfortable and low-standing, picking up the room’s subtle tones with an attractive wooden trim. This extends to the wardrobe, bedside lockers, chest of drawers and an elegant dressing table to complete the suite. Floor-length curtains will guarantee darkness when required, but the window is thoughtfully positioned to make the most of the morning light.

While each bedroom has been given its own unique interior design, they share a common aesthetic theme. The bathroom has an attractive wood-effect flooring and a large shower with marble wall-tiling.

The uniqueness of Elmville is that the keen eye of the interior designer is evident throughout and the bathroom is no exception. The large bath/shower delightfully features the notorious chic subway wall tiles, a long standing favourite in practical-meets-pleasing bathroom design.

The apartment is fitted with an intercom system for permission of access from within. The home is heated using an air-source pump and heat-recovery unit, a sensible and modern solution - highly efficient with low running costs.

Parking is available at an additional charge.

This house is in the centre of Sitric Road in Stoneybatter. One of the many things that make Sitric Road so cool is the beautiful old shop fronts, one of which is the bookshop and publishing house the Lilliput Press. Stroll down to the bottom of the street and you will find Lilliput Stores, which stocks the arguably best coffee in Dublin. This little shop won the Best shops in Ireland Irish Times award and it's right on the doorstep. Up the top of the street is Slice Restaurant, which is a great place to relax over a lazy Sunday brunch. Add to this the annual street party the Sitric Picnic and you have a pretty unique atmosphere on the road and a great community spirit. 

It's full of light and the sun catches the yard at the back for most of the day. It's cosy in winter especially when you get the open fire going, which warms the house from top to bottom. It was completely refurbished 10 years ago but most of the original features are still in the house, like the floor boards and doors. It has 2 good sized double bedrooms upstairs, a nice galley kitchen with loads of work-space, and plenty of space for parking out the front.

Stoneybatter has everything you need including great pubs and restaurants  Mulligan's for example is the excellent gastro pub just around the corner. 

The best thing about the area though is how close it is to town. 15 minutes walking will have you on Dame Street, or if you prefer to get in speedier there are loads of Dublin bikes stands around. Or if you want to shake off the city a bit, walk 10 minutes the opposite direction to the Phoenix Park.

Dillon Marshall are proud to present this breathtaking three bedroom Penthouse Apartment with Panoramic Views of the Sea. Located in the ever popular Neptune House, This stunning Penthouse apartment boast many original features such as high ceilings, the original stained-glass windows and ornate plaster work. These spacious and newly refurbished apartments have been uniquely designed with well-proportioned rooms, excellent specifications, thoughtful design and of course the highest standards of construction & workmanship.

The original house was built in c.1767 as a private Georgian Residence and was once the home to The Earl of Clonmel, Chief Justice of the King\' s Bench in 1784. In 1916 it was home to British reinforcement troops who landed in Dun Laoghaire for the purpose of defeating the Republican Army at the GPO and during the First World War it was set up as an auxiliary hospital. In 1930 it was opened as a charity for infants known as St Patricks Infants Hospital run by Mary Josephine Cruice.
Neptune House sits between the villages of Blackrock and Monkstown and blends perfectly into the mature surroundings. The houses are contemporary in design and are a visual contrast against the Georgian grandeur of the main house. All houses benefit from the very latest modern efficiencies that A-Rated homes enjoy. The houses employ the latest in modern technologies to achieve their A-rating including a highly efficient heat exchange heating system, state of the art Carlson windows. Internally, each house is fitted to a very high standard with beautiful fitted kitchens and premium integrated appliances, superior tiling, elegant fitted wardrobes and high ceilings at ground floor level.

Situated just 5 miles from Dublin City Centre, Blackrock combines total convenience with a wealth of exceptional amenities. Neptune House is within a short walk of both Blackrock and Monkstown villages hosting an excellent range of shops, churches, seafront walks and an unrivalled range of sports clubs. The DART is very convenient and an abundance of bus routes pass along the Rock Road.

From the moment you step inside, the attention to detail is evident. The high-end communal hallway features marble flagstone floors and commissioned artwork, setting a refined tone. With only two apartments per floor, each residence enjoys a dual-aspect layout.

Both bedrooms benefit from sea views, while the spacious open-plan kitchen, dining, and living area opens onto a southwest-facing main balcony with a further sea view, overlooking the beautifully landscaped green expanse of Paddy’s Hill.

Number 17 raglan Road is a stunning, completely refurbished and modernised residence that commands a triple-aspect view, and draws in all available light from every side. Originally built around 1875. Designed & refurbished by John Meagher of de Blacam & Meagher to, and, with help from a top team of professionals, set about this daunting project. The entire building was completely gutted, with internal floors, walls, windows and roofs removed. Given a clean slate, the walls were insulated and double-glazed windows installed, making it one of those rarities: an energy-efficient Victorian home - though it is Ber-exempt. Underfloor heating systems were installed, negating the need for radiators, thus leaving the walls free for furniture and shelving. The house has also been wired for phone, audio, TV and security system, and there's an interior vacuum system, eliminating the hassle of dragging a Hoover around the house. Anything that could be salvaged was lovingly restored, including the original cornicing. Anything that couldn't was replaced with an expertly sourced period piece, including the feature fireplaces and beautiful chandeliers. The five bathrooms and two guest WCs are particularly impressive, all laid out in luxurious marble. A team of Italian craftspeople fitted the bathrooms in Calacatta and Jerusalem Gold marble. In an impressive feat of craftsmanship, all the marble slabs have been near-perfectly bookmatched, with incredible results. The handmade cabinetry in the bathrooms was built by John Daly, and he took up the Italian challenge by bookmatching the grain on the timber. The main entrance has a tiled reception hall with ceiling coving and centre rose, and an inner hall with teak flooring. The large drawingroom and diningroom lead out to a sunroom/winter garden overlooking the rear, with folding doors that can be opened out to create a terrace, and remote-controlled rooflights fitted with rain sensors so they'll automatically close when the weather starts getting a bit Irish. You can imagine hosting elegant receptions, your guests enjoying aperitifs in this elegant space. There's also a large dual-aspect home office/library to the rear that gets lots of light in the afternoon and evening. Downstairs at garden level is a nicely laid out Bulthaup kitchen in a Hampton conservatory, with cantilevered units, large centre island and Gaggenau appliances, including an oven, steam oven and microwave lined up in an impressive row. The glass ceilings allow for all-day light, and the skylights are remote-controlled with rain sensors. It opens to a fully landscaped west-facing garden with cut granite walls and mature planting and hedging. There's an underground rainwater harvesting system that pumps grey water to irrigate the garden. A large family room adjoins the kitchen, and there's a small study/office and two bedrooms, one with en suite. Through an arch on the first-floor return you'll find a bright, dual-aspect bedroom and a bathroom with a large picture window to the side. The first floor is completely taken up with the magnificent dual-aspect main bedroom, with sliding sash picture windows commanding a view over raglan and Elgin roads, along with large walk-in wardrobe and en suite shower room. There's another bedroom suite on the third floor, along with a small room on the second-floor return that could work as a laundry/ironing room, a small study/office, or simply a handy storage space. Outside there's off-street parking for two (large) cars, accessed through electric sliding gates to the side.
